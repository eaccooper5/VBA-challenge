Use VBA to creak down yearly stock percentages and pricing in an Excel workbook. This was a learning exercise based on class materials for VBA. Unless noted otherwise, code was referenced from class exercises and demonstrations but some was suggested by tutor, Geronimo Perez, whose contributions are noted in code comments. This project was not finished but will be turned in as is.
